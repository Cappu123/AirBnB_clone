# Background Context
## Welcome to the AirBnB clone project!
Before starting, please read the <strong>AirBnB</strong> concept page.
### First step: Write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.
This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integrationâ€¦

Each task is linked and will help you to:
	* put in place a parent class (called <code>BaseModel</code>)to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
	* create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
	* create all classes used for AirBnB ( <code>User</code>, <code>State</coode>, <code>City</code>, <code>Place</code> ...)that inherit from <code>BaseModel</code>
